while i work on the website (and put my chaotic personality into words), here's credits where credit's due.

### thank you's

- to [Khushmeen Sidhu](https://khushmeen.com), whose [Doodle Icons](https://khushmeen.gumroad.com/l/doodleicons?layout=profile) were just the thing i was wanted for this website's vibe.
- to [Stefie Justprince](https://github.com/eifetx), for the [Sour Gummy Font](https://github.com/eifetx/Sour-Gummy-Fonts) which is somehow really close to my actual handwriting.
- to all the very very cool people at [IndieWebClub Bangalore](https://blr.indiewebclub.org), for nerding out on their setups to a point where i looked at my website and went, "fair enough i guess i should join in on the fun".
