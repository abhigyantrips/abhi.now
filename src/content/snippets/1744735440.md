<i>
  traveling in another city, i see glimpses of home;<br>
  from the white flowers to the gol chakkars full of stories.<br>
  and yet i'm not home.

the air stopped stopped using its petrichor perfume,<br>
and the trains of are afraid of being loud.

all this struggle; running, running someplace new,<br>
and yet i'm not home.
