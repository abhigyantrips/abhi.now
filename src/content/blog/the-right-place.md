> This post was written as a part of [IndieWebClub Meetup #19](https://blr.indiewebclub.org), where the prompt I chose was, "Write about your favorite local food joint."

It was 2AM on a certain Friday in Bombay. I was out with my family on a very unplanned, very long drive. It was at this moment when my mom declared that she wanted to have _“bisleri wale golgappe”_.

Putting aside the fact that it was practically criminal to call them _golgappe_ instead of _panipuri_ in this part of India, we promptly started to look for a place to eat in the city that never sleeps. As it somehow always is, any mention of food by anyone in a group promptly makes everyone else hungry as well.

This couldn’t just be any place. It had to have “_bisleri wale golgappe_”. It had to be a nice place, the _right_ place.

Much to our joy, we found exactly one place open with the phrase “_panipuri with bisleri_” plastered across the shopfront. It was boasted along with mentions of pizzas, sandwiches, _faloodas_ and so much more. We immediately started looking for a parking place because somehow, the entirety of Bombay had found this shop and decided to eat here.

We ordered much more than we could practically eat at the time, and my mom started her _golgappe_ spree just as she’d wanted. We’d achieved the bliss one only understands when they find the place they were looking for at the most uncertain of times. We’d found the right place for us.

About 3 months go by before I return home from college and we go on another family outing. It takes another 5 hours before — through much discussion — we recall the place we’d found past midnight with the _golgappe_ and the pizzas and the sandwiches. We ask one another about what the place was called or where it was located.

No one can remember the name.

It’s very weird to remember a place that had such an impact on you, but somehow not enough for you to remember the damn place. My search history was heavily damaged by this saga — “_golgappe place bisleri mumbai_”, “_sorry, **panipuri** place bisleri bombay_”, “_falooda place bombay_”, and Google knows what else. The largest search engine on the Internet had much trouble in finding me the right search result; what a pain in the ass.

What helped in finding the place was surprisingly sophisticated. I went through Google Photos to look at the pictures I’d taken that night. After somehow not taking any pictures at the actual _panipuri_ place (I was engrossed by the food, apparently), I found the last picture I’d taken before reaching there, of a guy selling _bhel puri_. I had somehow (for the first time I can remember) left my Location History on while taking the picture, and found the exact location of the _bhel puri_ dude. After a lot of reverse-searching and going “_golgappe — i mean, panipuri places in this area_”, I found it. The _right_ place.

No, genuinely, it was called "[Right Place](https://share.google/N0I3eztmj6tMfEGmw)".

I stared at my screen for what felt like an hour, and burst out in laughter before I decided to share the universe’s joke with my family.

As I conclude I’m starting to realize this wasn’t as much of a review as it was a story about a very aptly named shop. So uh, yeah, the food was great. 5 stars. Peace.
