**my family is my faith.**

my mother gave me clarity and patience.<br>
my father gave me determination and velocity.<br>
my nani gave me ultimate unconditional love.<br>
my nannoo gave me the quirky nature of my perspective on life.<br>
my sister shows me that the mistakes i made as a kid didn't look like mistakes to my family.

my family is my faith.
